# Project Aqueduct: Background and Overview

## Background

This sample is an experiment to learn more about Azure Digital Twins, DTDL langugage and our understanding on how to leverage functionalities within ADT. 
Our inspiration was process industry, and we picked something we don't have a lot of detailed domain knowledege on, so we would not be influenced on any industry specific ontologies. The idea of using a standardized ontology converted into DTDL is most often the best place to start, however we wanted to decline that approach in order to stimulate our free form learning and also show how one can use DTDL without pre-defined contraints.
> Note! For process industry, one of the ontologies you might want to evaluate is the [Energy Grid Ontology for Digital twins](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/energy-grid-ontology-for-digital-twins-is-now-available/ba-p/2325134) version.

Consider the DTDL created here purely as a learning exercise, with things to improve but also useful for us to share some of the things we evaluted and then change in the implementation as we learned more and more about both DTDL and ADT.
